I am James Blake Jurrens, a Computer Engineering student at Virginia Tech college of engineering.  I am currently in a several classes, including Data Structures and Algorithms.

I would really rather not put meaningful personal information on a public webpage online, and fully expect to have an increased number of spam emails because I made this website.
